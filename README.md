## Natural Language Processing  (NLP) Model for Sentiment Analysis

### Introduction

This project focuses on developing a Natural Language Processing (NLP) model for sentiment analysis, aiming to classify text into positive, negative, or neutral sentiment.The projectâ€™s goal is to enhance automated sentiment recognition, improving business insights, customer satisfaction analysis, and social media monitoring for more data-driven decision-making.

### Data

The dataset used in this analysis a large-scale dataset containing 241,000+ English language commentssourced from various online platforms. Each comment is annotated with a sentiment label: `Negative` (0), `Neutral` (1), and `Positive` (2). The goal of this project is to train and evaluate multi-class sentiment analysis models for real-world text data analysis. The dataset can be viewed and downloaded from [Kaggle](https://www.kaggle.com/datasets/abdelmalekeladjelet/sentiment-analysis-dataset)

### Exploratory Data Analysis
